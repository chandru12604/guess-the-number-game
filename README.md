🎮 Guess a Number Game

The Guess a Number game is a simple and fun interactive game built using React.js.

📝 How It Works:

The system randomly generates a number between 1 and 10.

The user enters their guess into the input box.

After submitting the guess, the game provides feedback:

If the guessed number is greater than the generated number, the game shows “Too High!”

If the guessed number is lower than the generated number, the game shows “Too Low!”

If the guessed number matches the generated number, the game shows “🎉 Correct! You guessed it!”

⚙️ Built With:

React.js for building a dynamic and responsive UI.

JavaScript for number generation and game logic.

CSS for styling the game interface.

🎯 Features:

Random number generation between 1–10.

Instant feedback on guesses.
